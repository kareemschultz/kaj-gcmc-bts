# Project Status: GCMC-KAJ SaaS Platform

This document tracks the completion status of the GCMC-KAJ Better-T Stack monorepo.

**Migration Start Date**: November 15, 2025
**Migration Complete Date**: November 15, 2025
**Current Branch**: `claude/full-system-completion-01PdkDzspFjC9cg1Sqg5nHai`
**Source Repository**: `kareemschultz/kaj-gcmc-saas-platform` (Next.js 15 + tRPC + NextAuth)
**Target Repository**: `kareemschultz/kaj-gcmc-bts` (Better-T Stack monorepo)
**Build Status**: ✅ **SUCCESSFUL** - All 10 packages building
**Production Readiness**: ~85% Complete

---

## Overview

## Current Stabilization (2025-02-13)

- ✅ Web, API, portal, and worker builds succeed via `bun run build`.
- ✅ Dockerfiles copy the correct `bun.lock` and include health checks for each service.
- ✅ Worker now loads root environment files and uses port 3003 by default to avoid conflicts with the portal dev server.
- ✅ Prisma client generation works; database push/tests require a running Postgres instance.
- ⚠️ Vitest and Prisma commands will fail when Postgres/Redis are offline—start them via `docker compose up -d postgres redis minio`.

### Goals
1. Migrate from NextAuth v5 to Better-Auth while preserving multi-tenant functionality
2. Restructure into Turborepo monorepo with better separation of concerns
3. Maintain all business logic, RBAC, and multi-tenant isolation
4. Preserve all 22 tRPC routers and frontend functionality
5. Ensure production-ready deployment with Docker

### Tech Stack Changes

| **Auth** | NextAuth v5 | Better-Auth |
| **Runtime** | Node.js | Bun |
| **API Server** | Next.js API routes | Hono |
| **Linter** | ESLint + Prettier | Biome |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL + Prisma | PostgreSQL + Prisma ✅ |
| **Storage** | MinIO | MinIO ✅ |
| **Queue** | BullMQ + Redis | BullMQ + Redis ✅ (config only) |
