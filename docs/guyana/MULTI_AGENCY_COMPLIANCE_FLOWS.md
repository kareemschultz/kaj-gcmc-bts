---

## Summary: The Three-Agency Model

### Foundational Sequence
1. **DCRA:** Establishes legal entity
2. **GRA:** Enables taxation and business transactions
3. **NIS:** Provides employee social security

### Ongoing Relationship
- **DCRA:** Annual governance and corporate updates
- **GRA:** Monthly/quarterly/annual tax compliance
- **NIS:** Monthly contribution and annual reconciliation

### Interconnection Points
- Tax Compliance Certificate (GRA → required by DCRA, Procurement)
- NIS Compliance (NIS → required by GRA Licenses, Tenders)
- Business Registration (DCRA → required by GRA, NIS)

---

## Best Practices for Multi-Agency Compliance

### 1. Maintain a Compliance Calendar
Use a centralized calendar tracking:
- Monthly filing deadlines (GRA VAT, PAYE, Withholding; NIS Contributions)
- Quarterly obligations
- Annual return deadlines
- License renewal dates

### 2. Keep Organized Records
Maintain separate folders for:
- DCRA: Annual returns, beneficial ownership, company documents
- GRA: Tax returns, VAT records, PAYE summaries, correspondence
- NIS: Contribution schedules, payment receipts, annual returns
- Licenses: Applications, renewals, certificates

### 3. Use Electronic Filing When Available
- GRA eServices: [eservices.gra.gov.gy](https://eservices.gra.gov.gy)
- NIS eSchedule: [esched.nis.org.gy](https://esched.nis.org.gy)
- Faster processing and confirmation

### 4. Plan Ahead for Compliance Certificates
- Request Tax Compliance Certificate 2-3 weeks before needed
- Request NIS Compliance Certificate in advance of deadlines
- Ensure no outstanding returns or payments blocking issuance

### 5. Engage Professional Services
Consider hiring:
- Accountant for tax and financial statement preparation
- Company secretary for DCRA annual returns and corporate governance
- Payroll service for PAYE and NIS calculation and filing
